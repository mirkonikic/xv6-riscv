<h1>Lab: system calls</h1>

<p>In the last lab you used system calls to write a few utilities. In
this lab you will add some new system calls to xv6, which will help
you understand how they work and will expose you to some of the
internals of the xv6 kernel.  You will add more system calls in later
labs.

<div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 2 of
    the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and
    Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter 4, and
  related source files:

  <ul>

    <li> The user-space "stubs" that route system calls into the kernel are in <tt>user/usys.S</tt>,
      which is generated by <tt>user/usys.pl</tt> when you run <tt>make</tt>.
      Declarations are in <tt>user/user.h</tt>

    <li> The kernel-space code that routes a system call to the
    kernel function that implements it
    is in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt> and <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>.

    <li> Process-related code is <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt> and <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>.

  </ul>
</div>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the syscall branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout syscall</kbd>
  $ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
  </pre>

<p>If you run <tt>make grade</tt> you will see that the grading script cannot
exec
  <tt>trace</tt> and <tt>sysinfotest</tt>.  Your job is to add the
  necessary system calls and stubs to make them work.

<h2>Using gdb <script>g("easy")</script></h2>

<p>In many cases, print statements will be sufficient to debug your
kernel, but sometimes being able to single step through some assembly
code or inspecting the variables on the stack is helpful.

<p>To learn more about how to run GDB and the common issues that can
arise when using GDB, check out <a href="gdb.html">this page</a>.

<p> To help you become familiar with gdb, run <kbd>make qemu-gdb</kbd> and
then fire up gdb in another window
(see the gdb bullet on the <a href="guidance.html">guidance page</a>). Once you have two windows open, type in the gdb window:
<pre>
(gdb) <kbd>b syscall</kbd>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80002142: file kernel/syscall.c, line 243.
(gdb) <kbd>c</kbd>
Continuing.
[Switching to Thread 1.2]

Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:243
243     {
(gdb) <kbd>layout src</kbd>
(gdb) <kbd>backtrace</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The <tt>layout</tt> command splits the window in two, showing where
  gdb is in the source code. The <tt>backtrace</tt> prints out the
  stack
  backtrace</tt>. See <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/lec/gdb_slides.pdf">Using
  the GNU Debugger</a> for helpful GDB commands.</li>


<p>Answer the following questions (store the answers in
answers-syscall.txt):

  <div class="question">
    Looking at the backtrace output, which function
    called <tt>syscall</tt>?
  </div>

<p> Type <kbd>n</kbd> a few times to step pass <tt> struct proc *p = myproc();</tt>
    Once past this statement, type <kbd>p /x
    *p</kbd>, which prints the current process's <tt>proc struct</tt>
    (see <tt>kernel/proc.h></tt>) in hex.

  <div class="question">
    What is the value of <tt>p->trapframe->a7</tt> and what does that
    value represent?  (Hint: look <tt>user/initcode.S</tt>, the first
    user program xv6 starts.)
  </div>

<p>The processor is running in kernel mode, and we can print privileged
  registers such as <tt>sstatus</tt>
  (see <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Priv-v1.12/riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf">RISC-V
    privileged instructions</a> for a description):

  <pre>
    (gdb) <kbd>p /x $sstatus</kbd>
  </pre>

   <div class="question">
     What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
   </div>

<p>In the subsequent part of this lab (or in following labs), it may
  happen that you make a programming error that causes the xv6 kernel
  to panic. For example, replace the statement <tt>num = p->trapframe->a7;</tt>
with
  <tt>num = * (int *) 0;</tt>
  at the beginning of <tt>syscall</tt>, run <kbd>make
  qemu</kbd>, and you will see:
  <pre>
xv6 kernel is booting

hart 2 starting
hart 1 starting
scause 0x000000000000000d
sepc=0x000000008000215a stval=0x0000000000000000
panic: kerneltrap
  </pre>
Quit out of <tt>qemu</tt>.

<p>To track down the source of a kernel page-fault panic, search for
  the <tt>sepc</tt> value printed for the panic you just saw
  in the
  file <tt>kernel/kernel.asm</tt>, which contains the assembly for the
  compiled kernel.

  <div class="question">
    Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at.
    Which register corresponds to the varialable <tt>num</tt>?
  </div>

<p>To inspect the state of the processor and the kernel at the
faulting instruction, fire up gdb, and set a breakpoint at the
faulting <tt>epc</tt>, like this:
<pre>
(gdb) <kbd>b *0x000000008000215a</kbd>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8000215a: file kernel/syscall.c, line 247.
(gdb) <kbd>layout asm</kbd>
(gdb) <kbd>c</kbd>
Continuing.
[Switching to Thread 1.3]

Thread 3 hit Breakpoint 1, syscall () at kernel/syscall.c:247
</pre>

<p>Confirm that the faulting assembly instruction is the same as the
  one you found above.

  <div class="question">
    Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text;
    is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space?  Is that
    confirmed by the value in <tt>scause</tt> above? (See description
    of <tt>scause</tt>
    in <a href="https:n//github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Priv-v1.12/riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf">RISC-V
    privileged instructions</a>)
  </div>

<p>Note that <tt>scause</tt> was printed by the kernel panic above,
  but often you need to look at additional info to track down the
  problem that caused the panic.  For example, to find out which user
  process was running when the kernel paniced, you can print out the
  process's name:
  <pre>
    (gdb) <kbd>p p->name</kbd>
  </pre>

    <div class="question">
      What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel
      paniced?  What is its process id (<tt>pid</tt>)?
  </div>

<p>This concludes a brief introduction to tracking down bugs with gdb;
  it is worth your time to revisit
  <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/lec/gdb_slides.pdf">Using
  the GNU Debugger</a> when tracking down kernel bugs.
  The <a href="guidance.html">guidance page</a> also has some other
  other useful debugging tips.

<h2>System call tracing <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  In this assignment you will add a system call tracing feature that
  may help you when debugging later labs.  You'll create a
  new <tt>trace</tt> system call that will control tracing. It should
  take one argument, an integer "mask", whose bits specify which
  system calls to trace.  For example, to trace the fork system call,
  a program calls <tt>trace(1 << SYS_fork)</tt>, where <tt>SYS_fork</tt> is a
  syscall number from <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>. You have to modify
  the xv6 kernel to print out a line when each system call is about to
  return, if the system call's number is set in the mask.
  The line should contain the
  process id, the name of the system call and the
  return value; you don't need to print the system call
  arguments. The <tt>trace</tt> system call should enable tracing
  for the process that calls it and any children that it subsequently forks,
  but should not affect other processes.
</div>

<p>We provide a <tt>trace</tt> user-level program that runs another
  program with tracing enabled (see <tt>user/trace.c</tt>). When you're
  done, you should see output like this:

<pre>
$ trace 32 grep hello README
3: syscall read -> 1023
3: syscall read -> 966
3: syscall read -> 70
3: syscall read -> 0
$
$ trace 2147483647 grep hello README
4: syscall trace -> 0
4: syscall exec -> 3
4: syscall open -> 3
4: syscall read -> 1023
4: syscall read -> 966
4: syscall read -> 70
4: syscall read -> 0
4: syscall close -> 0
$
$ grep hello README
$
$ trace 2 usertests forkforkfork
usertests starting
test forkforkfork: 407: syscall fork -> 408
408: syscall fork -> 409
409: syscall fork -> 410
410: syscall fork -> 411
409: syscall fork -> 412
410: syscall fork -> 413
409: syscall fork -> 414
411: syscall fork -> 415
...
$
</pre>

<p>In the first example above, trace invokes grep tracing just the
read system call. The 32 is <tt>1&lt;&lt;SYS_read</tt>. In the second
example, trace runs grep while tracing all system calls; the
2147483647 has all 31 low bits set. In the third example, the program
isn't traced, so no trace output is printed. In the fourth example,
the fork system calls of all the descendants of the <tt>forkforkfork</tt> test
in <tt>usertests</tt> are being traced. Your solution is correct if your
program behaves as shown above (though the process IDs may be
different).

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>

    <li><p>Add <tt>$U/_trace</tt> to UPROGS in Makefile

    <li><p>Run <kbd>make qemu</kbd> and you will see that the
	compiler cannot compile <tt>user/trace.c</tt>, because the
	user-space stubs for the system call don't exist yet: add a
	prototype for the system call to <tt>user/user.h</tt>, a stub
	to <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, and a syscall number
	to <tt>kernel/syscall.h</tt>.  The Makefile invokes the perl
	script <tt>user/usys.pl</tt>, which produces <tt>user/usys.S</tt>,
	the actual system call stubs, which use the
	RISC-V <tt>ecall</tt> instruction to transition to the
	kernel. Once you fix the compilation issues,
	run <kbd>trace 32 grep hello README</kbd>; it will fail
	because you haven't implemented the system call in the kernel
	yet.

    <li><p>Add a <tt>sys_trace()</tt> function
	in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt> that implements the new system
	call by remembering its argument in a new variable in
	the <tt>proc</tt> structure (see <tt>kernel/proc.h</tt>). The
	functions to retrieve system call arguments from user space are
	in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt>, and you can see examples
        of their use in <tt>kernel/sysproc.c</tt>.
   </li>

    <li><p>Modify <tt>fork()</tt> (see <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>) to copy
    the trace mask from the parent to the child process. </li>

    <li><p>Modify the <tt>syscall()</tt> function
	in <tt>kernel/syscall.c</tt> to print the trace output. You will need to add an array of syscall names to index into.</li>

    <li><p>If a test case passes when you run it inside qemu directly but
  you get a timeout when running the tests using <tt>make grade</tt>, try
  testing your implementation on Athena. Some of tests in this lab can be a bit
  too computationally intensive for your local machine (especially if you use
  WSL).</li>

  </ul>

<h2>Sysinfo <script>g("moderate")</script></h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  In this assignment you will add a system call, <tt>sysinfo</tt>,
  that collects information about the running system.  The system call
  takes one argument: a pointer to a <tt>struct sysinfo</tt>
  (see <tt>kernel/sysinfo.h</tt>). The kernel should fill out the
  fields of this struct: the <tt>freemem</tt> field should be set
  to the number of bytes of free memory, and the <tt>nproc</tt>
  field should be set to the number of processes whose <tt>state</tt>
  is not <tt>UNUSED</tt>.
  We provide a test program <tt>sysinfotest</tt>; you pass this
  assignment if it prints "sysinfotest: OK".
</div>

<p>Some hints:
<ul>

<li><p>Add <tt>$U/_sysinfotest</tt> to UPROGS in Makefile

<li><p>Run <kbd>make qemu</kbd>; <tt>user/sysinfotest.c</tt> will
  fail to compile. Add the system call sysinfo, following the same
  steps as in the previous assignment. To declare the prototype for
  sysinfo() <tt>in user/user.h</tt> you need predeclare the existence
  of <tt>struct sysinfo</tt>:
  <pre>
    struct sysinfo;
    int sysinfo(struct sysinfo *);
  </pre>
Once you fix the compilation issues, run
  <kbd>sysinfotest</kbd>; it will fail because you haven't
  implemented the system call in the kernel yet.
</li>

<li><p>sysinfo needs to copy a <tt>struct sysinfo</tt> back to user
  space; see <tt>sys_fstat()</tt> (<tt>kernel/sysfile.c</tt>)
  and <tt>filestat()</tt> (<tt>kernel/file.c</tt>) for examples of how
  to do that using <tt>copyout()</tt>.
</li>

<li><p>To collect the amount of free memory, add a
  function to <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>
</li>

<li><p>To collect the number of processes, add a
  function to <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>
</li>

</ul>
